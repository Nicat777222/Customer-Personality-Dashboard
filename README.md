## Key Features
- **Customer Segmentation:** Analysis by Marital Status, Education, Income, and presence of Kids/Teenagers.

- **Product Preferences:** Identifying popular products among various customer groups.
- **Web Activity Analysis:** Understanding customer engagement through website visits.
- **Complaint and Response Tracking:** Monitoring customer satisfaction and campaign responsiveness.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### 1. High-Value Customer Segment:
- **Insight:** Married/Together customers with higher education (PhD, Graduation) and income show the highest engagement and spending on products like Wines and Meat.
- **Recommendation:** Tailor premium product offerings and loyalty programs specifically for this segment.

### 2. Campaign Effectiveness:
- **Insight:** Campaign 1 (e.g., **44 accepts**) showed the lowest acceptance rate, while Campaign 5 (e.g., **353 accepts**) was significantly more successful. Married customers consistently show the highest acceptance across all campaigns.
- **Recommendation:** Analyze the strategy (channel, messaging, timing) of Campaign 5 to replicate its success in future campaigns. Re-evaluate or discontinue underperforming campaigns.

### 3. Optimal Customer Enrollment Periods:
- **Insight:** Customer registrations peak in **March, May, August, and October**.
- **Recommendation:** Increase marketing budget and launch targeted campaigns just before and during these peak months, aligning content with seasonal consumer behavior (e.g., Spring offers, Back-to-School, Holiday prep).

### 4. Product Preferences:
- **Insight:** Wines and Meat products are the most frequently purchased categories across all customer segments.
- **Recommendation:** Implement cross-selling strategies by pairing these popular products with complementary items.

### 5. Website Engagement:
- **Insight:** Most customers visit the website 5-7 times per month, with Married/Together groups being the most active.
- **Recommendation:** Introduce exit-intent pop-ups or personalized offers for high-frequency, low-conversion website visitors.
